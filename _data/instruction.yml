# Instructional Experience

## Training Sesssions
I have led many training sessions in my career, starting with
teaching adult education courses on computer use while in
highschool, training on new processes and procedures while
at Citigroup, and most recently I have led Linux and HPC
related training sessions at Iowa State University, often
with 30 or more people.

I have also started to become involved in the HPC carpentry
project, and led the production of over 25 professional 
quality training videos which are published on YouTube
and available for users in our facility to help get started.
